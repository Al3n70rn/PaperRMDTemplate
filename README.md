##A template to use for simple academic reports

I always need to hunt for more complicated RMarkdown syntax, particularly for the YAML front matter. I don't generally consider that to be time well spent, so here is a consolidation of some of the more complex things I run into when creating simple reports.

Take a look at the .pdf version to see how it all comes together.

Includes:
  - Yaml front matter syntax for:
    - Title
    - Author
    - Date
    - Figure Captions
    - Abstract
    - References
  - RMarkdown syntax for:
    - Images
      - Captions
      - Resizing
    - References
    
Enjoy, edit, reuse!
